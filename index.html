            <p>
                To my Pasandida Aurat, <br>
                You have brought so much light, love, and happiness into my life. Every moment with you is a treasure,
                and I am endlessly grateful for your presence. This little gift is a reflection of the love I feel for you,
                and I hope it brings a smile to your face, just like you bring
                joy to my heart every day. <br> Bas is baat ka dukh hai ki,
                finally god introduced a fine girl in my life and now it's
                gonna be a long distance relationship...ðŸ˜­ <br>
                I want you to be mine forever, just don't leave me, alright. I
                don't know how I fell in this much love for you. <br> This is
                just an infinitely small portion of my love, hope you love it.
                And remember, foster it forever.
                <br><br>
                With all my love, <br> Your Pasandida Mard
